        ## 🤖 GitHub Copilot Agent Work
        This issue is designed for automated completion by GitHub Copilot agents.

        **⚠️ Important Git Flow:**
        1. Copilot should create branch from `develop` (not main)
        2. Branch naming: `copilot/[issue-number]-[brief-description]`
        3. PR should target `develop` branch for staging review
        4. After review, will be merged to `main` for production

        Example: `copilot/345-component-test-coverage` → PR to `develop`
